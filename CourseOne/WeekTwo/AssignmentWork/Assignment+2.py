# # Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
# ## Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 
# 
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

# In[1]:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()


# ### Question 0 (Example)
# 
# What is the first country in df?
# 
# *This function should return a Series.*

# In[6]:

# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero() 


# ### Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[30]:

def answer_one():
    summer_gold = df['Gold']
    return summer_gold.idxmax()


# ### Question 2
# Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[26]:

def answer_two():
    summer_gold = df['Gold']
    winter_gold = df['Gold.1']
    gold_diff = abs(summer_gold - winter_gold)

    return gold_diff.idxmax()


# ### Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 
# 
# $$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$
# 
# Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[131]:

def answer_three():
    df_gold_in_summer_winter = df.loc[(df['Gold'] >= 1) & (df['Gold.1'] >= 1)]
    summer_gold = df_gold_in_summer_winter['Gold']
    winter_gold = df_gold_in_summer_winter['Gold.1']
    total_gold = df_gold_in_summer_winter['Gold.2']
    
    return ((summer_gold-winter_gold) / total_gold).idxmax()


# ### Question 4
# Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.
# 
# *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

# In[41]:

def answer_four():
    return df['Gold.2'] * 3 + df['Silver.2'] * 2 + df['Bronze.2']
    


# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
# 
# The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.
# 
# ### Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[4]:

census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head()


# In[117]:

def answer_five():
    return census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]['STNAME'].value_counts().idxmax()


# ### Question 6
# **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.
# 
# *This function should return a list of string values.*

# In[185]:

def answer_six():
    filtered_df = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    filtered_df = filtered_df.sort_values(['STNAME', 'CENSUS2010POP'], ascending=False)
    grouped_df = filtered_df.groupby('STNAME')
    return list(grouped_df.nth([0,1,2])['CENSUS2010POP'].groupby(level=0).sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(3).index)
answer_six()


# ### Question 7
# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# 
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[36]:

def answer_seven():
    county_pops = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50][['POPESTIMATE2010', 'POPESTIMATE2011', 'POPESTIMATE2012', 'POPESTIMATE2013', 'POPESTIMATE2014', 'POPESTIMATE2015']]
    def max_abs_change(pops):
        return pops.max() - pops.min()
    
    max_abs_change = county_pops.apply(max_abs_change, reduce=True, axis=1)
    max_abs_change.name = 'max_abs_change'
    
    
    a = pd.concat([census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]['CTYNAME'], max_abs_change], axis=1)
    a.set_index('CTYNAME', inplace=True)

    return a['max_abs_change'].idxmax()

answer_seven()


# ### Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 
# 
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
# 
# *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*

# In[57]:

def answer_eight():
    counties_only = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    lower_regions = counties_only[(counties_only['REGION'] == 1) | (counties_only['REGION'] == 2)]
    growing_pops_only = lower_regions[lower_regions['POPESTIMATE2015'] > lower_regions['POPESTIMATE2014']]
    wash_only = growing_pops_only[growing_pops_only['CTYNAME'].str.startswith('Washington')]
    return wash_only[['STNAME', 'CTYNAME']].sort_index()
